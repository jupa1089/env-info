## Schedule

- 8:30 - 9:15 [BB] **data wrangling demo** [wk04_tidyr](../wk04_tidyr.html) functions from dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, and stringr libraries by walking through examples all together

- 9:15 - 9:45 [BB] **data wrangling individual** exercises answering questions from a dataset on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

- 9:45 - 10:00 **break**

- 10:00 - 10:30 [BB] **data wrangling group** work asking questions and answering them with your own datasets

- 10:30 - 11:30 [NT] **programming concepts**

  - [Programming lecture](programming1.pdf) [30 min]
  - [Programming examples](programming.examples.html) ( [Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsb-bren/env-info/gh-pages/wk04_tidyr/programming.examples.Rmd))
  - Programming group exercise [30 min]

## Assignments

### Data Wrangling (Individual)

1. Append the header `## 4. Tidying up Data` to your `env-info/students/<user>.Rmd` and include R chunks to run the demo and answer the questions in [wk04_tidyr](../wk04_tidyr.html). You'll find it easiest to copy and paste the demo portion from the raw [env-info/wk04_tidyr.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsb-bren/env-info/gh-pages/wk04_tidyr.Rmd) but will need to understand this material enough to apply the functions to the CO<sub>2</sub> dataset as R chunks and answer all the questions.

### Programming (Group)

1. Write a function in R to do some data analysis or simulation that your group will find interesting (use this to start on your project)
    * include at least two different data types
    * return a list
    * make sure you document your program
1. Add this function to your organization's github repository - Note this is how we will check to make sure you have completed the assignment - so make sure that you have committed and pushed your function to that organization's repository.
