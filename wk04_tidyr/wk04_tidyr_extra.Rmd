### nycflights13

flights departing NYC in 2013

We'll use this example dataset to play with functions in the `dplyr` package, with code extracted from the excellent presentation by [\@tjmahr](https://github.com/tjmahr): [`dplyr` -- verbs for manipulating data-frames](http://rpubs.com/tjmahr/dplyr_2015).

```{r nycflights13, eval=F}
# load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13) # install.packages('nycflights13')
?airlines
?planes
?airports
?weather
?flights
```


### `tbl_df`

create a "data frame tbl"

The main advantage to using a `tbl_df` over a regular `data.frame` is the printing: tbl objects only print a few rows and all the columns that fit on one screen, describing the rest of it as text and including the data type.

```{r dplyr tbl_df, eval=F}
# Convert data to a tbl_df so that it uses dplyr's nice print method
flights <- tbl_df(flights)
flights
```

### `glimpse`

view data horizontally

```{r dplyr glimpse, eval=F}
# Use glimpse to few some values in each column
glimpse(flights)
```

### `filter`

limit rows

```{r dplyr filter, eval=F}
# How many flights flew to Madison in 2013?
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "MSN")

# filter: multiple conditions
# How many flights flew to Madison in first week of January?
# Comma separated conditions are combined with '&'
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "MSN", month == 1, day <= 7)

# Question: Commas in the filter statement are implicit & (and) operators. Is there anything similar for | (or)?
# Logical OR statements are supported, but there's no shorthand.
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "MSN" | dest == "ORD" | dest == "MDW")
# For more complicated checks, I would try a set operation.
flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% c("MSN", "ORD", "MDW"))
```

`filter()` is similar to the base function `subset()`, but preferred since each argument is AND'ed together, whereas `subset()` interprets the second argument as columns to select, which is better handled seperately with the dplyr's `select()` function.

### `arrange`

sort rows by columns

```{r dplyr arrange, eval=F}
# Sort by which airport they departed from in NYC, then year, month, day.
flights %>%
  arrange(origin, year, month, day)

# desc: reverses sorting of a column
# Find longest delayed flights to Madison.
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "MSN") %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```

### `select`

select/rename columns

```{r dplyr select, eval=F}
# Select the columns you want.
flights %>%
  select(origin, year, month, day)

# select's helpers
# select has many helper functions. See ?select.
flights %>%
  select(origin, year:day, starts_with("dep"))

# negative selecting
# We can drop columns by “negating” the name. Since helpers give us column names, we can negate them too.
flights %>%
  select(-dest, -starts_with("arr"),
         -ends_with("time"))
```

**Recap** verbs for inspecting data:

- convert to a `tbl_df` - nice print method
- `glimpse` - some of each column
- `filter` - subsetting
- `arrange` - sorting (desc to reverse the sort)
- `select` - picking (and omiting) columns

**Next**: verbs for manipulating data:

- convert to a `tbl_df` - nice print method
- `glimpse` - some of each column
- `filter` - subsetting
- `arrange` - sorting (desc to reverse the sort)
- `select` - picking (and omiting) columns


### `rename`

rename columns

```{r dplyr rename, eval=F}
# Rename columns with rename(NewName = OldName). To keep the order correct, read/remember the renaming = as “was”.
flights %>%
  rename(y = year, m = month, d = day)
```

### `mutate`

add new variables

```{r dplyr mutate, eval=F}
# How much departure delay did the flight make up for in the air?
flights %>%
  mutate(
    gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
    speed = (distance / air_time) * 60,
    gain_per_hour = gain / (air_time / 60)) %>%
  select(gain:gain_per_hour)
```

### `group_by`, `summarise`

aggregate rows

```{r dplyr group_by, eval=F}
# Let's compute the average delay per month of flights to Madison.

# Normally–in aggregate, by or plyr's d*ply functions–you specify the grouping as an argument to the aggregation function.
aggregate(dep_delay ~ month, flights, mean,
          subset = flights$dest == "MSN")

# group_by
# In dplyr, grouping is its own action. It is done as its own step in the pipeline. Here, we filter to the flights to Madison and group_by month.
msn_by_month <- flights %>%
  filter(dest == "MSN") %>%
  group_by(month)
msn_by_month

# summarise
# Now we use summarise to compute (several) aggregate values within each group (month). summarise returns one row per group.
msn_by_month %>%
  summarise(
    flights = n(),
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_planes = n_distinct(tailnum))

# tally
# tally is a shortcut for counting number of items per group.
# Number of flights from NYC by destination by month:
flights %>%
  group_by(dest, month) %>%
  tally

# ungroup
# Remove the grouping structure with ungroup.
msn_by_month %>% ungroup

# Summarizing undoes grouping.
# Each summarise statement peels off one layer of grouping (from the right of the list of groups).
# day gets peeled off
per_day <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest, year, month, day) %>%
  summarise(flights = n())
per_day

# Peel off month grouping
per_month <- per_day %>%
  summarise(flights = sum(flights))
per_month

# mutate also respects grouping

# Rank flight delays within each destination and month. (dplyr provides
# a bunch of ranking functions. See the [cheatsheet][cheatsheets].)
flights %>%
  group_by(dest, month) %>%
  mutate(timely = row_number(dep_delay),
         late = row_number(desc(dep_delay))) %>%
  select(dep_delay, timely:late)

# This is also good for mean-centering variables within groups.
mean_center <- function(xs) {
  xs - mean(xs, na.rm = TRUE)
}
flights %>%
  group_by(dest, month) %>%
  mutate(c_delay = mean_center(dep_delay)) %>%
  select(dep_delay, c_delay)
```

**Recap**: That covers 80% of dplyr:

- `select`
- `filter`
- `arrange`
- `glimpse`
- `rename`
- `mutate`
- `group_by`, `ungroup`
- `summarise`

**Other** 20%:

- assembly: `bind_rows`, `bind_cols`
- column-wise operations: `mutate_each`, `summarise_each`
- join tables together: `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join`, `full_join`
- filtering joins: `semi_join`, `anti_join
- `do`: arbitrary code on each chunk
- different types of tabular data (databases, data.tables)

- join, inner, outer, anti. vs merge. relational database.
- middleware abstraction. try with sqlite as relational db.

## tidyr...

- what is an observation? wide vs long format

## emissions

- top 3 emitters in last year?  compared to rest of world?

- cumulative emissions?

- per capita? join

- join with population over time. get at emissions per capita
- rank worst 10
- get at cumulative emissions
- join with GDP. fit model, who excessively bad/goodget?
